initUI()
//A method is a named group of Java statements that can be called. 
It is similar to a subroutine or function in other programming languages. 
The term init() is a method name in Java. The name is followed by Java code within { and }. 
A method has a name, such as init, and parentheses, such as ( ). 
The parentheses may contain arguments if the method is intended to receive some information to use in its statements. T
he init() method has no arguments inside the parentheses. That means that no data are passed to the init() method. 
Still, a method must have the parentheses to be identified as a method in Java. That is an important rule to know.//

invokeLater ()
//The invokeLater() is a method in java on swing package and belongs to SwingUtilities class. 
Invokelater is used by java swing developer to update or perform any task on Event dispatcher
thread asynchronously.invokeLater has been added into Java API from swing 
extension and it belongs to SwingUtilities class.//

//If you see the signature of invokeLater method you will find that invokeLater takes a 
Runnable object and queues it to be processed by EventDispatcher thread. EDT thread will
process this request only after sorting out all AWT pending events or requests.//

//InvokeLater is used to perform a task asynchronously in AWT Event dispatcher thread while InvokeAndWait 
is used to perform task synchronously.//
//InvokeLater is non-blocking call while InvokeAndWait will block until the task is completed.//

ex
//example//

null
//A null value thus indicates an unset reference (i.e. a reference to nothing)//
Unlike common misconception, null is not Object or neither a type. Itâ€™s just a special value, 
which can be assigned to any reference type and you can type cast null to any type//

String
//a line of numbers//

args
//In Java args contains the supplied command-line arguments as an array of String objects.
In other words, if you run your program as java MyProgram one two then args will contain ["one", "two"]//

@Override
//Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that 
is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, 
same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, 
then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.//

public static void
// public means that the method is visible and can be called from other objects of other types. 
Other alternatives are private, protected, package and package-private. See here for more details.//
//static means that the method is associated with the class, not a specific instance (object) of that class. 
This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.//
//void means that the method has no return value. If the method returned an int you would write int instead of void.//

actListner

//A button listener must implement the ActionListener interface. ActionListener is an interface (not a class) that 
contains a single method:

public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent evt) ;

A class that implements the interface must contain an actionPerformed() method. 
The ActionEvent parameter is an Event object that represents an event (a button click). 
It contains information about the event.

Import the package java.awt.event.* if you are dealing with events.

The listener object could be defined in a class other than the frame class.
//


ItemListener
//public interface ItemListener
extends EventListener
The listener interface for receiving item events. The class that is interested in processing an item event implements 
this interface. The object created with that class is then registered with a component using the component's 
addItemListener method. When an item-selection event occurs, the listener object's itemStateChanged method is invoked.//


NumberFormat
//NumberFormat is the abstract base class for all number formats. 
This class provides the interface for formatting and parsing numbers. 
NumberFormat also provides methods for determining which locales have number formats, and what their names are.
NumberFormat helps you to format and parse numbers for any locale. 
Your code can be completely independent of the locale conventions for decimal points, thousands-separators, 
or even the particular decimal digits used, or whether the number format is even decimal.
To format a number for the current Locale, use one of the factory class methods:
  myString = NumberFormat.getInstance().format(myNumber);//
  
public long
//public final class Long
extends Number
implements Comparable<Long>

The Long class wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object. An object of type Long contains a 
single field whose type is long. In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a long to a 
String and a String to a long, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a long//

long
//The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. 
The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1. 
In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, 
which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1. 
Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int. 
The Long class also contains methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc to support 
arithmetic operations for unsigned long.//

timePanel
//shows the current time in Java//

JComboBox<Integer>
//A JComboBox, which lets the user choose one of several choices, can have two very different forms. 
The default form is the uneditable combo box, which features a button and a drop-down list of values. 
The second form, called the editable combo box, features a text field with a small button abutting it. 
The user can type a value in the text field or click the button to display a drop-down list. 
Here's what the two forms of combo boxes look like in the Java look and feel//
//Combo boxes require little screen space, and their editable (text field) form is useful for letting the user quickly 
choose a value without limiting the user to the displayed values. Other components that can display one-of-many choices 
are groups of radio buttons and lists. Groups of radio buttons are generally the easiest for users to understand, 
but combo boxes can be more appropriate when space is limited or more than a few choices are available. 
Lists are not terribly attractive, but they're more appropriate than combo boxes when the number of items 
is large (say, over 20) or when selecting multiple items might be valid.//

getActionCommand
//getActionCommand() gives you a String representing the action command. 
The value is component specific; for a JButton you have the option to set the value with setActionCommand(String command) but for a JTextField if you don't set this, 
it will automatically give you the value of the text field. 
According to the javadoc this is for compatability with java.awt.TextField//
